Pure <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> tooltips have been a thing for a while now but all of the solutions I've found have had limitations. After reading throughÂ Louis Lazaris's article <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/pure-css-tool-tips/">Pure <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> Tool Tips Revisited</a> over at <a href="http://impressivewebs.com">ImpressiveWebs</a>, I decided to make a few modifications of my own to his design.<!--more-->

<h2>The Problem</h2>

Louis's design broke some of the boundaries but still had some limitations. These were my goals:

<h3>Multiline</h3>

Louis makes the argument that tooltips are only supposed to contain a small amount of information, eliminating the need for multiline tooltips. I agree with him to an extent, but I still think there are cases in which you would want a multiline tooltip. In my example, I am creating an error message rather than your average tooltip. I wanted my first line to be only the error type, then all of the following lines would contain the error message.

<h3>IE8 Compatible</h3>

This was a big one since the company I'm doing this project for requires it. Fortunately we only have to support IE8, Firefox, and Webkit. Keep in mind, however, that this also means I don't know how this code will react in IE7 and below.

<h3>No Extra HTML</h3>

Some other pure <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> tooltip solutions use extra elements, like placeholder spans or divs. I wanted to be able to pull in all of the information I needed without any extra elements. I bend the extra HTML rule a little bit since we do use an element's attributes to populate the tooltip but I think I can still live with myself.

<h2>The Solution</h2>

You probably noticed the custom <strong>data-</strong> attributes on the link. The <code>data-tooltip</code> attribute is binary, meaning it's either set or it's not, just like <code>required</code>. I'll be using jQuery to create and populate the other two attributes in the final project but for now we'll just use some bunk data.

<h3>Pseudo-classes and Uncommon Attributes</h3>

<strong><em>DISCLAIMER</em></strong> If you're here, you probably already know about most of this stuff. If so, feel free to skip to the next section.

Most pseudo-classes describe some state of an element, i.e. <code>:hover</code> applies when the element is being hovered, <code>:focus</code> applies to form elements that are in focus, <code>:disabled</code> applies to elements that are disabled, etc. However, <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> are a little different. They are used to prepend and append, respectively, content to  an element. For example you could use <code>.emailAddress:before</code> to append a label to the internal node of every element with a class of <code>emailAddress</code>.

You have probably seen most of this <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> before, though we're using a couple of pretty uncommon attributes. The <code>content</code> attribute only works with the <code>:before</code> and <code>:after</code> pseudo-classes. It determines what to prepend/append to the element. In this case we're using a pretty cool argument called <code>attr(x)</code>. It allows you to use the value from any attribute applied to the element as the content of the prepended/appended element. In our case we used the custom <code>data-</code> attributes we set earlier.

The <code>white-space</code> is another strange one. It's used to determine how white space (spaces and returns) should be handled inside of an element. We used <code>white-space:pre-wrap;</code> so that the spaces inside the <code>content</code> attribute would be preserved, specifically the **&#92;a` which is a Unicode carriage return, pretty much the only way to ensure that the line breaks where we want.

<h3>Positioning</h3>

This was the most important point to allowing multiline tooltips. Some previous solutions have used percentage positioning, some used pixel positioning, but they all used the <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> attributes. However these always break if you have more than one line so they are often used with <code>white-space:nowrap;</code>.

Instead of positioning negatively based on the top position of the element like Louis did, I set the top position of the tooltip to zero so it would line up with the top of the element, then gave the tooltip a <code>margin-top</code>. In my example, I'm placing the tooltip on a link so I set the bottom margin to 1em, ensuring the margin would always be the same height as my text. This may need to be adjusted depending on your line-height.

If you're not positioning the tooltip on a line of text then you can also set your margin to match the height of a static height element, or use some jQuery magic to adjust it.

<h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>

The rest of this code is pretty standard stuff. One other peculiar thing we're doing here is using the <code>:before</code> to create the arrow on the bottom of the tooltip. <a href="http://www.impressivewebs.com/pure-css-tool-tips/">Louis's article</a> explains that part a bit and there are plenty of other tutorials on creating shapes using divs and borders so I won't cover that.

I've tested this in all of the necessary browsers (IE8+, Firefox, and Google Chrome) and haven't seen any issues yet. If you run into an issue or have a recommendation for making it even better, let me know in the comments! I'll do another tutorial in the future about how to make this guy extensible using jQuery. ;-)
